Introducing the Analytics API: a lightweight way for plugins to instrument key
events that could help inform a Backstage Integrator how their instance of
Backstage is being used. The API consists of the following:

- `useAnalytics()`, a hook to be used inside plugin components which retrieves
  an Analytics Tracker.
- `tracker.captureEvent()`, a method on the tracker used to instrument key
  events. The method expects a verb (the action performed), a noun (a unique
  identifier of the object the action is being taken on), and optionally a
  numeric metric/value.
- `<AnalyticsDomain />`, a way to declaratively attach additional information
  to any/all events captured in the underlying React tree. There is also a
  `withAnalyticsDomain()` HOC utility.
- The `tracker.captureEvent()` method also accepts a `context` object for
  optionally providing additional run-time information about an event.

By default, captured events are not sent anywhere. In order to collect and
redirect events to an analytics system, the `analyticsApi` will need to be
implemented and instantiated by an App Integrator.
